# Dum-E IOT

This repository holds all files needed to create a swarm of internet enabled robotic arms. All .dxf files and 3D models can be found in the "Robot Files" folder. All code needed to host a Node.js Heroku server is also included here. 

This project was made for MakeHarvard 2019 and is intended as a teaching tool for robot enthusiasts. The board used to control these arms is a generic NodeMCU ESP-8266 Wifi board. The servos used were standard 180Â° rotation servos. The CAD files can be modified to fit servos of different sizes. 

A wiring diagram is not currently available but will be created in the near future. Pictures of the completed project will be uploaded shortly.
